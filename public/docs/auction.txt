About Creating NFT Auctions

Welcome to the ElefantasticAuction creation page! Here you can list your NFTs for auction.

How to Create an Auction

Select Your NFT: Choose an NFT from your wallet that you wish to auction.

Set Starting Bid: Determine the minimum starting bid for your auction. Let’s say you’d like to get at least 5 ELFT Tokens — input 5 and click the arrow up on the input field to add the necessary decimals, making it 5.0001.

Choose Currency: Select whether you want bids in ETH or ELFT tokens.

Set Duration: Choose how long your auction will run.

Approve NFT Transfer: You'll need to approve the auction contract to transfer your NFT when the auction completes.

Create Auction: Confirm the transaction to list your NFT.

Important Information

Committed Listing: Once an auction starts, it cannot be cancelled until it ends.

Anti-Sniping Protection: If a bid is placed in the final 15 minutes, the auction is extended by 15 minutes.

Supported Collections: Only NFTs from whitelisted collections can be auctioned.

Gas Fees: Creating an auction requires two transactions (approve + create), and you'll pay gas fees for both.

No Platform Fees: We don’t charge any fees — you receive 100% of the winning bid.

After Your Auction Ends

If your auction receives bids, the highest bidder can claim the NFT after the auction ends.

When the winner claims the NFT, the bid amount will be added to your withdrawal balance found in “My Dashboard.”

You can withdraw your funds from the My Dashboard page.

If no bids are placed, you'll need to claim your NFT back from the Dashboard. You only pay for gas and can try listing your NFT again.

Tips for Successful Auctions

Set a reasonable starting bid to attract initial interest.

Choose the right duration — longer isn’t always better.

Consider which currency your target buyers prefer.

Share your auction on social media to drive more bidders.

Monitor your auction in the Dashboard to track bidding activity.
