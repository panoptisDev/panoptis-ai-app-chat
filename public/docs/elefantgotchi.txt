ElefantgotchiV2 Laboratory Guide

What can I do in the Elefantgotchi Laboratory?
The ElefantgotchiV2 Laboratory is where you can manage and improve your Elefantgotchi NFTs. You can:
- Upgrade different traits of your Elefantgotchis
- Breed two Elefantgotchis to create a new one with combined traits
- Restart hibernating Elefantgotchis (or burn them if you no longer want them)
- Pet your Elefantgotchis to care for them and help them evolve
- Track the evolution progress of your Elefantgotchi collection

Upgrade Traits
Each Elefantgotchi has 5 traits that affect its staking power:
Base Reward: The basic daily reward rate
Bonus Reward: Extra rewards earned during active staking
Penalty Rate: How quickly rewards decrease during hibernation
Bonus Period: How long the bonus lasts
Multiplier: Overall reward multiplier

Each upgrade costs 20 ELFT tokens and increases a trait by 10 points.
There's a cooldown period between upgrades, shown in the interface.

Breeding
Breeding allows you to create a new Elefantgotchi by combining traits from two parents:
Select two different parent Elefantgotchis you own
Pay 20 ELFT tokens for breeding
The new Elefantgotchi will have traits derived from both parents
Each Elefantgotchi can only breed once in its lifetime
Itâ€™s like a 3 for the price of 2 deal

Breeding is a great way to create Elefantgotchis with better trait combinations!

Hibernation Management
Elefantgotchis enter hibernation if not regularly petted or from other contract interactions. When hibernating:
They don't earn staking rewards
Their staking power decreases over time
You can restart them for 20 ELFT tokens
Or burn them if you no longer want them

Petting & Evolution
Regular petting keeps your Elefantgotchis healthy and helps them evolve:
Pet every 24 hours to maintain health
Every 10 pets your Elefantgotchi evolves to the next stage
- ðŸ¥‰ â†’ ðŸ¥ˆ â†’ ðŸ¥‡ Evolution stages: Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold
Higher evolution stages have better staking bonuses
A fully upgraded Elefantgotchi often brings a higher value on auctions

Gas Costs & Transactions
Each action in the laboratory requires a blockchain transaction:
You'll need to approve ELFT token spending (for upgrades, breeding, and restarting)
each transaction requires gas fees in addition to any ELFT costs
Wait for transaction confirmations before performing another action

Keep some ETH in your wallet for gas fees!
